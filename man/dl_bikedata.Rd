\usage{
dl_bikedata(city = "nyc", data_dir = tempdir(), dates, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{city}{City for which to download bike data, or name of corresponding
bike system (see Details below).}

\item{data_dir}{Directory to which to download the files}

\item{dates}{Character vector of dates to download data with dates formated
as YYYYMM.}

\item{quiet}{If FALSE, progress is displayed on screen}
}
\description{
Download hire bicycle data
}
\note{
Only files that don't already exist in \code{data_dir} will be
downloaded, and this function may thus be used to update a directory of files
by downloading more recent files. If a particular file request fails,
downloading will continue regardless. To ensure all files are downloaded,
this function may need to be run several times until a message appears
declaring that 'All data files already exist'
}
\section{Details}{

This function produces zip-compressed data in R's temporary directory. City
names are not case sensitive, and must only be long enough to unambiguously
designate the desired city. Names of corresponding bike systems can also be
given.  Currently possible cities (with minimal designations in parentheses)
and names of bike hire systems are:
\tabular{lr}{
 New York City (ny)\tab Citibike\cr
 Washington, D.C. (dc)\tab Capital Bike Share\cr
 Chicago (ch)\tab Divvy Bikes\cr
 Los Angeles (la)\tab Metro Bike Share\cr
 Boston (bo)\tab Hubway\cr
 London (lo)\tab Santander Cycles\cr
